**1.1 What is Fiction?** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*Some students balk at the prospect of reading fiction during English
class, while others devour it quickly. The reality is that there are
many good reasons to study fiction, which has interesting characters and
plots nurturing our imaginations and creating in us realistic emotions
to which we can relate. Fiction enables readers to better understand the
human condition and to become more observant of their surroundings.
Reading also increases literacy skills so that students become more
proficient readers and writers. By reading fiction, you will build your
vocabulary and become more open minded and worldly. Therefore, it is
important to study the purposes, types, and structures of fiction, which
are described in this subunit. After taking notes, you will be better
prepared to read and comprehend the variety of short fiction texts that
you will study during this subunit. *

**1.6 Narrative Writing Style** <span id="1.6"></span> 
*In preparation for writing your own narrative, you will review the
basic structures and styles of narrative writing. Some of the short
stories that you will read in this course are in a narrative style, with
characters speaking from the first point of view. Narratives are
different from fiction in that the author is telling a true story but in
a more artistic way by adding in strong imagery that evokes the various
senses. Narratives comprise their own genre in literature. *

**1.9.3 Character Motivation** <span id="1.9.3"></span> 
*Motivation is a powerful force, and what motivates characters to behave
in certain ways, like the narrator killing the old man in Poe’s story,
reveals a lot about those characters. Motivation can be extrinsic, where
external incentives like money and friends determine behavior.
Motivation can also be intrinsic, where internal forces such as love and
fear determine behavior. For example, a student might study hard to
receive an “A” on an exam, because high grades make him feel
accomplished and confident (internal). Another student might earn good
grades because she wants a boost in her allowance (external). Think
about what motivates you to behave in certain ways. Are you more
externally or internally motivated?*

-   **Activity: Motivation in “The Tell-Tale Heart”**
    Instructions: Using the short story, answer the following questions
    in your notebook. Use complete sentences and make sure that each
    response is accompanied by a quote from the story.  
        
         1.    What is the narrator’s personality like?  
         2.    How does the narrator behave throughout the story?  
         3.    What motivates the narrator to commit murder?  
         4.    What drives him to confess?  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 45 minutes.
