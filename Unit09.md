**9.2 Historical Climate** <span id="9.2"></span> 
*When reading nonfiction literature, it is helpful to have some
background information on the historical climate (setting) prior to
reading. Frederick Douglass’s novel is a slave narrative, so information
on the plight of slaves before the Civil War is essential. *

    Labor”](https://www.boundless.com/u-s-history/slavery-and-reform-1820-1840/slavery-in-the-u-s/slave-labor/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the article on the types of slave labor that
    existed in the United States. While the majority of slavery existed
