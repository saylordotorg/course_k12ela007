In seventh-grade English Language Arts, you will read a variety of short
and full-length fiction and nonfiction texts, becoming more independent
in your ability to analyze themes and structure. Explaining an author’s
purpose and using text-based details to support your analyses are skills
you will develop in this course. You will also learn how to define
unfamiliar language and increase your vocabulary knowledge while gaining
the skills necessary to become a more confident writer. To that end, you
will improve your ability to write clear, cohesive four-paragraph essays
that follow grammatical and spelling conventions. In order to develop
advanced language awareness, you will read sophisticated texts and learn
how to identify figurative language. This will help you become a more
confident reader and writer in all subject areas as well as other facets
of your life. Using technology throughout the course to further your
understanding of the subject matter and to publish your original work
will help give you the skills and the confidence you need to succeed in
a 21<sup>st</sup>-century classroom.
